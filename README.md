# Links
2/3 links were working correctly which were Management, Mareketing, but not Optimization
noticed that the difference in code was that the other two had "div id" when the incorrect one had "div class," so just changed "class" to "id"

# Semantic Structure
For the HTML to follow semantic structure I replaced the "div" parents with "header, nav, section, and footer"

The CSS I got rid of the "div class" command so I deleted the period as well, just leaving the main title for that section
Also gettin rid of "header div" and replacing it with "nav"

When it got to the ".benefit" command, I cosolidated all three commands on the same line since they were reading the same code in the curly's

Rinse and repeated with the next sets of code with the same information

# Commented
Separated the sections to identify the different commands by commenting out
